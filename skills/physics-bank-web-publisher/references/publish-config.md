## practice_set.system

Current Pocket Cosmos accepted systems include:

- `ap-physics-1`
- `ap-physics-2`
- `ap-c-mech`
- `ap-c-em`
- `igcse`
- `competition`
- `bpho`
- `a-level`
- `physics-bowl`

## practice_kind

Use:

- `mcq` when the set is primarily multiple-choice
- `structured` for FRQ/structured-response sets

The compiler still derives each step mode from whether the individual question has choices.

## Access is deliberately not part of this config

Publishing content does not grant students access and does not change practice permissions. Access remains a separate site/admin concern.

## Layout degradation

Keep `allow_layout_degradation=false` unless the user explicitly accepts the current frontend limitation.

Setting it to true does not remove the original layout. The complete `layoutBlocks` remains under `metadata.physicsBank`, and the compiled question is marked degraded.
