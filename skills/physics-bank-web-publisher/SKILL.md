# Physics Bank Web Publisher v1.0

Publish a finished `physics-bank` question bank into Pocket Cosmos. This is a **compiler/publisher**, not another extraction pipeline.

The source of truth before publication is the validated physics-bank bundle. The source of truth after publication is Pocket Cosmos Supabase:

```text
physics-bank
→ compile
→ publish bundle
→ upload content-addressed assets
→ atomic DB transaction
→ verify Supabase
→ verify /api/practice/sets/:id
→ optional live visual check
```

## Target architecture

Pocket Cosmos production currently uses:

- Vercel project: `pocket-cosmos-online`
- production site: `https://www.pocket-cosmos.com`
- Supabase project ref: `bnnxjqdwvzbkjbjfkofs`
- database identity table: `public.questions`
- immutable content versions: `public.question_versions`
- version-bound assets: `public.question_assets`
- private asset bucket: `question-assets`

Do not put new bank images back into GitHub/Vercel static asset folders.

Read before execution:

- `references/pocket-cosmos-runtime-schema.md`
- `references/publish-config.md`
- `references/storage-contract.md`
- the parent physics-bank `SKILL.md`, especially semantic classification and narrative-layout requirements

## Required input

A completed physics-bank directory containing at minimum:

```text
question-bank/
  questions.json
  assets.json
  classification-taxonomy.json
  assets/
    figures/
    choices/
```

and a publisher config using `pocket-cosmos-publish-config/v1`.

## Gate 1 — validate the source bank

Run the parent physics-bank validators first. Never publish a bank that fails text, year, visual, layout, or semantic validation.

Typical commands from the repository root:

```bash
python scripts/validate_bank.py <bank>/questions.json \
  --assets <bank>/assets.json --strict --require-text-review

python scripts/validate_year_metadata.py <bank>/questions.json

python scripts/validate_semantic_classification.py <bank>/questions.json \
  --taxonomy <bank>/classification-taxonomy.json --strict
```

## Gate 2 — compile, do not copy

Run:

```bash
python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/compile_publish_bundle.py \
  <bank> <publish-config.json> \
  --output <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json
```

The compiler maps the canonical bank into the current website runtime contract while preserving the full future-facing information under `question_versions.metadata.physicsBank`.

Important mappings:

- stable web question ID: `<practice-set-id>::<physics-bank-question-id>`
- `questions.legacy_question_id`: physics-bank question ID
- `question_versions.stem`: `context + stem` so current UI remains self-contained
- `practiceStep.prompt`: same self-contained display prompt
- physics-bank `classification` → `metadata.physicsBank.classification`
- physics-bank `difficulty` → `practiceStep.difficulty`
- readable topic/difficulty tags first; machine semantic tags are preserved after them
- choice assets → `question_assets.role=choice` + `choice_key`
- first compatible narrative figure → `role=stem, metadata.slot=image`
- later compatible figures → `role=figure, metadata.slot=supportingImages`

## Narrative-layout compatibility — hard gate

The current Pocket Cosmos Practice UI renders:

```text
prompt
→ main image
→ supporting images
→ choices
```

It does **not** currently render arbitrary `layout_blocks`.

Therefore a physics-bank question is web-compatible only when all narrative text appears before all stem/shared figures. If the bank contains:

```text
figure → text
text → figure → text
figure → text → figure
```

or any other interleaving, publishing is blocked by default.

This protects questions such as multi-image FRQs from silently losing the image positions that physics-bank deliberately preserved.

An explicit config override `rendering.allow_layout_degradation=true` may compile such a question for temporary use. The full `layoutBlocks` still remains in `metadata.physicsBank`, and the publish bundle must mark `renderCompatibility.status=degraded`.

Never silently downgrade layout fidelity.

## Gate 3 — validate the publish bundle

Run:

```bash
python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/validate_publish_bundle.py \
  <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json --bank-root <bank>
```

This checks stable IDs, unique positions, content hashes, asset hashes/paths, current runtime metadata, choice bindings, and layout compatibility.

## Plan before apply

Default behavior is planning only. Do not write production merely because compilation succeeded.

Create the read-only diff:

```bash
python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/plan_publish.py \
  <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json \
  --output <bank>/web-publish-plan.json
```

It requires server-side `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` but performs no writes.

A publish plan must state for every question:

- stable question ID
- desired content hash
- whether the hash already exists
- new version required or no-op
- asset paths to upload
- render compatibility

Content hashes deliberately exclude signed URLs, database UUIDs, and timestamps.

## Asset upload

Storage paths are immutable and content-addressed:

```text
question-assets/
  banks/<practice-set-id>/assets/<asset-id>-<sha12>.<ext>
```

Upload before DB mutation:

```bash
python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/upload_assets.py \
  <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json --bank-root <bank> --apply
```

The script requires server-side credentials:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

Never expose the service-role key to browser/client code or commit it to Git.

Uploads use `x-upsert: false`. A changed file receives a new hash-derived path instead of overwriting CDN content.

## Atomic DB apply

After every required asset upload succeeds, generate the transaction:

```bash
python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/build_transaction_sql.py \
  <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json \
  --output <bank>/web-publish.sql
```

When the Supabase connector is available, execute the generated SQL against project `bnnxjqdwvzbkjbjfkofs` as **one transaction**.

The SQL:

1. upserts stable `questions` identities/positions;
2. reuses an existing `question_versions` row when `question_id + content_hash` already exists;
3. otherwise appends `max(version)+1`;
4. inserts version-bound `question_assets`;
5. never overwrites or deletes historical question versions.

Do not retire questions missing from a new bundle unless the user explicitly requests retirement.

## Verification

After apply:

1. verify DB identities, expected content hashes, and asset rows:

   ```bash
   python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/verify_database.py \
     <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json
   ```

2. verify `/api/practice/catalog` contains the new/updated set;
3. fetch `/api/practice/sets/<practice-set-id>` and verify question IDs/count/order and non-null `questionVersionId`:

   ```bash
   python skills/physics-bank-web-publisher/scripts/verify_published_set.py \
     <bank>/web-publish-bundle.json
   ```

4. confirm choice images and stem/supporting images resolve;
5. when browser access and permissions allow, visually inspect representative questions, including:
   - text-only question;
   - stem-figure question;
   - visual-choice question;
   - multi-figure question.

For locked practice sets, a 403 from the public API is not evidence of failed publication. Verify via Supabase and repeat API/UI verification with an authenticated session if available.

## Versioning rules

`questions.id` is stable identity. `question_versions` is immutable history.

- same canonical content hash → no new version
- changed text/answer/classification/layout/asset hash/runtime mapping → new version
- changed signed URL/timestamp/UUID → must **not** create a new version
- asset bytes change → asset storage path changes because SHA changes

## What this Skill never does

- does not re-OCR or repair source questions;
- does not reclassify physics content;
- does not guess missing images;
- does not discard `classification`, `layout_blocks`, provenance, or source pages;
- does not modify student attempts/assignments;
- does not alter practice permissions;
- does not silently publish layout-degraded questions;
- does not delete historical versions.
